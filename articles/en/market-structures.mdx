# Market Structures

The way firms behave — how they set prices, how much they produce, whether they innovate — depends critically on the **market structure** in which they operate. Market structure describes the competitive environment: how many firms exist, how easy it is to enter the industry, and how much control any single firm has over price.

## Overview of Market Structures

The four canonical market structures differ along several key dimensions:

## Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is the benchmark model — an idealized market structure that serves as a reference point for evaluating all others.

### Assumptions

1. **Many small firms** — each too small to influence market price
2. **Homogeneous product** — buyers see all firms' output as identical
3. **Free entry and exit** — no barriers to entering or leaving the industry
4. **Perfect information** — all buyers and sellers know all prices and product qualities
5. **No transaction costs** — costless to buy and sell

### The Firm's Demand Curve

Because the firm is a **price taker**, it faces a perfectly elastic (horizontal) demand curve at the market price $P^*$. It can sell any quantity at $P^*$ but nothing above it.

This means:

$$
AR = MR = P^*
$$

where $AR$ is average revenue and $MR$ is marginal revenue.

### Profit Maximization

The firm maximizes profit where $MR = MC$, which in perfect competition simplifies to:

$$
P = MC
$$

<Collapse title="Derivation: Profit Maximization Condition">

Profit is defined as:

$$
\pi = TR - TC = P \cdot Q - TC(Q)
$$

Taking the first-order condition:

$$
\frac{d\pi}{dQ} = \frac{d(TR)}{dQ} - \frac{d(TC)}{dQ} = MR - MC = 0
$$

Therefore $MR = MC$. Since $MR = P$ in perfect competition, we get $P = MC$.

The second-order condition requires $MC$ to be rising at the optimum (i.e., the MC curve cuts MR from below).
</Collapse>

### Short-Run Outcomes

In the short run, a perfectly competitive firm can earn:

- **Positive economic profit** when $P > ATC$ at the profit-maximizing output
- **Zero economic profit** (normal profit) when $P = ATC$
- **Negative economic profit** (loss) when $P < ATC$

**Shutdown condition**: The firm should shut down if $P < AVC$ (price falls below average variable cost). At this point, the firm cannot even cover its variable costs and loses more by producing than by shutting down.

$$
\text{Shutdown if } P < AVC_{\min}
$$

### Long-Run Equilibrium

In the long run, free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero:

- If $\pi > 0$: new firms enter → supply increases → price falls → profit shrinks
- If $\pi < 0$: firms exit → supply decreases → price rises → losses diminish

**Long-run equilibrium condition:**

$$
P = MC = AC_{\min}
$$

<Callout type="info">
**Efficiency in perfect competition**: At long-run equilibrium, perfect competition achieves both **allocative efficiency** ($P = MC$, resources go where consumers value them most) and **productive efficiency** ($P = AC_{\min}$, production at lowest possible cost).
</Callout>

## Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition combines features of both perfect competition and monopoly. Firms compete, but each offers a slightly different product.

### Characteristics

1. **Many firms** in the market
2. **Differentiated products** — each firm's product is a close but not perfect substitute
3. **Low barriers to entry** — relatively easy to enter and exit
4. **Some price-setting power** — because products are differentiated, firms face downward-sloping demand

### Short-Run Analysis

The firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, so $P > MR$. Profit maximization occurs at $MR = MC$, with the price read from the demand curve.

In the short run, firms can earn positive or negative economic profit.

### Long-Run Equilibrium

Just as in perfect competition, free entry/exit drives long-run economic profit to zero. New firms enter when profits are positive, stealing market share. The firm's demand curve shifts left until profit is zero:

$$
P = ATC \quad \text{(at the profit-maximizing quantity)}
$$

However, unlike perfect competition, the tangency occurs to the **left** of the minimum of $ATC$.

<Callout type="warning">
**Key inefficiency**: Monopolistic competition is neither productively efficient ($P > AC_{\min}$, excess capacity) nor allocatively efficient ($P > MC$). Consumers pay more and firms produce less than the socially optimal level.
</Callout>

### Comparison with Perfect Competition

| Criterion | Perfect Competition | Monopolistic Competition |
|---|---|---|
| Long-run profit | Zero | Zero |
| $P$ vs $MC$ | $P = MC$ | $P > MC$ |
| Production at $AC_{\min}$? | Yes | No (excess capacity) |
| Allocative efficiency | Yes | No |
| Productive efficiency | Yes | No |
| Product variety | None | High |

The trade-off: monopolistic competition sacrifices some efficiency but provides **product diversity** that consumers value.

## Oligopoly

An oligopoly is a market dominated by a **few large firms** whose decisions are strategically interdependent — each firm must consider how rivals will react to its choices.

### Key Features

1. **Few firms** dominate the market
2. **Significant barriers to entry** — economies of scale, capital requirements, patents, branding
3. **Strategic interdependence** — each firm's optimal strategy depends on what others do
4. **Products may be homogeneous or differentiated**

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Homogeneous Oligopoly">
Firms sell identical products (e.g., steel, cement, crude oil). Competition focuses mainly on price and quantity.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Differentiated Oligopoly">
Firms sell differentiated products (e.g., automobiles, smartphones, airlines). Competition includes branding, features, advertising, and service alongside price.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Collusive Oligopoly (Cartel)

Firms may **collude** — explicitly or tacitly — to restrict output and raise prices, behaving collectively like a monopolist. A **cartel** is a formal collusive agreement.

- **Joint profit maximization**: The cartel sets total output where industry $MR = MC$
- **Problem**: Each member has an incentive to **cheat** by producing more than its quota (prisoner's dilemma)
- **Cartels are typically illegal** in most countries (OPEC is a notable exception as a sovereign cartel)

### Dominant Firm Model

One large firm (the **dominant firm**) has a significant cost advantage or brand recognition, coexisting with a **competitive fringe** of smaller firms. The dominant firm sets the price; the fringe firms are price takers.

### The Kinked Demand Curve Model

This model explains **price rigidity** in oligopolies:

- If a firm **raises** its price, rivals do **not** follow → the firm loses many customers (elastic demand above the kink)
- If a firm **lowers** its price, rivals **match** the cut → the firm gains few new customers (inelastic demand below the kink)

The result is a **kink** in the demand curve at the prevailing price, producing a discontinuity in the $MR$ curve. The $MC$ curve can shift within this gap without changing the optimal price — explaining why oligopoly prices tend to be **sticky**.

### Duopoly Models

<Collapse title="Cournot, Bertrand, and Stackelberg Models">

**Cournot Model (Quantity Competition)**
- Firms simultaneously choose quantities
- Each firm assumes the other's quantity is fixed (best-response functions)
- Equilibrium: each firm produces more than the monopoly share but less than the competitive level
- Total output: between monopoly and perfect competition

**Bertrand Model (Price Competition)**
- Firms simultaneously choose prices
- With homogeneous products, the equilibrium is $P = MC$ (competitive outcome!) even with just two firms
- This "Bertrand paradox" shows that price competition can be extremely fierce

**Stackelberg Model (Sequential Quantity Leadership)**
- One firm (the leader) moves first, choosing quantity
- The follower observes and responds optimally
- The leader gains a **first-mover advantage**, producing more and earning higher profit than the follower
</Collapse>

## Monopoly

<Definition term="Monopoly">
A market structure where a **single firm** is the sole supplier of a good with no close substitutes. The monopolist is a **price maker** and faces the entire market demand curve.
</Definition>

A monopoly exists when a **single firm** is the sole producer in the market with no close substitutes.

### Sources of Monopoly Power

- **Legal barriers**: patents, copyrights, government licenses, franchises
- **Natural monopoly**: economies of scale so large that one firm can serve the entire market at lower cost than two or more firms (e.g., electricity distribution)
- **Control of essential resources**: exclusive ownership of a key input
- **Network effects**: value of a product increases with the number of users

### Demand and Revenue

The monopolist faces the **entire market demand curve**, which is downward-sloping. To sell more, it must lower the price on **all** units:

$$
MR = P + Q \cdot \frac{dP}{dQ} < P
$$

Since $\frac{dP}{dQ} < 0$, marginal revenue is always less than price.

<Collapse title="MR and Elasticity Relationship">

Marginal revenue can be expressed in terms of price elasticity of demand $E_d$:

$$
MR = P\left(1 + \frac{1}{E_d}\right) = P\left(1 - \frac{1}{|E_d|}\right)
$$

Since the monopolist produces where $MR > 0$, it always operates in the **elastic** portion of the demand curve ($|E_d| > 1$).

For a linear demand curve $P = a - bQ$:

$$
TR = aQ - bQ^2 \implies MR = a - 2bQ
$$

The MR curve has the same intercept but **twice the slope** of the demand curve.
</Collapse>

  <Slider name="mc1" min={0.5} max={3} default={1} step={0.1} label="MC slope" />
</Graph>

### Profit Maximization

The monopolist maximizes profit where:

$$
MR = MC
$$

The price is then read off the **demand curve** at the profit-maximizing quantity $Q^*$:

$$
P^* = D(Q^*) > MR = MC
$$

This means the monopolist charges a price **above** marginal cost, creating a markup.

### Efficiency and Deadweight Loss

<Callout type="error">
**Monopoly is inefficient**: Because $P > MC$, the monopolist produces less than the socially optimal quantity. This creates a **deadweight loss** — a net loss of total surplus that neither the producer nor consumers capture. Some consumer surplus is also transferred to the monopolist as economic profit.
</Callout>

Compared to perfect competition:
- **Output is lower**: $Q_m < Q_c$
- **Price is higher**: $P_m > P_c$
- **No allocative efficiency**: $P > MC$
- **No productive efficiency**: not necessarily at $AC_{\min}$

## Price Discrimination

Price discrimination occurs when a firm charges **different prices** to different consumers (or for different units) for the **same product**, where the price differences are not justified by cost differences.

### Conditions for Price Discrimination

1. The firm must have **market power** (downward-sloping demand)
2. The firm must be able to **identify** consumers with different willingness to pay
3. **Resale must be prevented** (arbitrage must be impossible)

<Tabs>
<Tab label="1st Degree (Perfect)">
The firm charges each consumer their **maximum willingness to pay** for each unit. This captures **all** consumer surplus as producer surplus.

- **Result**: No deadweight loss! Output equals the competitive level.
- **In practice**: Nearly impossible; approximated by haggling, auctions, or personalized pricing algorithms.
</Tab>

<Tab label="2nd Degree (Quantity)">
The firm charges different prices per unit based on the **quantity purchased** (quantity discounts, block pricing, bundling).

- **Examples**: Electricity tiered pricing, "buy 2, get 1 free," software licensing tiers
- Consumers **self-select** into pricing tiers based on their own demand
</Tab>

<Tab label="3rd Degree (Segmentation)">
The firm charges different prices to different **identifiable market segments** based on observable characteristics.

- **Examples**: Student discounts, senior pricing, geographic pricing, peak vs off-peak
- The firm sets $MR_1 = MR_2 = MC$ across segments
- Higher price for the segment with **less elastic** demand

$$
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1 - 1/|E_2|}{1 - 1/|E_1|}
$$
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monopsony

A **monopsony** is a market with a **single buyer**. It is the mirror image of monopoly.

| Feature | Monopoly (single seller) | Monopsony (single buyer) |
|---|---|---|
| Market power on | Supply side | Demand side |
| Faces | Downward-sloping demand | Upward-sloping supply |
| Key distortion | $P > MC$ (too little sold) | $W < MRP$ (too little bought) |
| Example | Patented drug maker | Company town employer, large retailer |

The monopsonist faces an upward-sloping supply curve. To hire more labor (or buy more input), it must raise the wage (price) for **all** units, making the marginal factor cost ($MFC$) exceed the supply price:

$$
MFC > W \quad \text{(supply price)}
$$

The monopsonist hires where $MFC = MRP$ (marginal revenue product), resulting in **lower wages and less employment** than in a competitive labor market.

<Callout type="info">
When a monopsony employer faces a monopoly union (bilateral monopoly), the outcome is **indeterminate** by theory alone — it depends on bargaining power.
</Callout>
