### Worked Example: Finding Market Equilibrium

**Problem:** The demand function is $P = 100 - 2Q_D$ and the supply function is $P = 20 + 3Q_S$. Find the equilibrium price and quantity.

<Collapse title="Step-by-step solution">

**Step 1:** At equilibrium, quantity demanded equals quantity supplied ($Q_D = Q_S = Q^*$) and the prices are equal:

$$
100 - 2Q = 20 + 3Q
$$

**Step 2:** Solve for $Q^*$:

$$
100 - 20 = 3Q + 2Q
$$

$$
80 = 5Q
$$

$$
Q^* = 16
$$

**Step 3:** Substitute $Q^* = 16$ into either function to find $P^*$:

$$
P^* = 100 - 2(16) = 100 - 32 = 68
$$

**Verification** using the supply function:

$$
P^* = 20 + 3(16) = 20 + 48 = 68 \checkmark
$$

**Result:** The equilibrium quantity is $Q^* = 16$ units and the equilibrium price is $P^* = 68$ monetary units.

<Quiz>
  <Question text="The law of diminishing marginal utility states that:">
    <Option value="a">Total utility always decreases</Option>
    <Option value="b" correct>As consumption of a good increases, the additional utility from each extra unit decreases</Option>
    <Option value="c">Marginal utility is always negative</Option>
    <Option value="d">Consumers always prefer less of a good</Option>
  </Question>
  <Question text="Indifference curves are typically:">
    <Option value="a">Upward-sloping and linear</Option>
    <Option value="b">Horizontal lines</Option>
    <Option value="c" correct>Downward-sloping and convex to the origin</Option>
    <Option value="d">Circles around the optimal point</Option>
  </Question>
  <Question text="The slope of the budget constraint is determined by:">
    <Option value="a">Consumer income only</Option>
    <Option value="b">Total utility</Option>
    <Option value="c" correct>The ratio of the prices of the two goods ($-P_1 / P_2$)</Option>
    <Option value="d">The marginal rate of substitution</Option>
  </Question>
</Quiz>

### Worked Example: Optimal Consumer Choice

**Problem:** A consumer has income $Y = 600$, prices $P_1 = 20$ and $P_2 = 30$, and utility function $U = q_1 \cdot q_2$. Find the optimal consumption basket.

<Collapse title="Step-by-step solution">

**Step 1:** Write the budget constraint:

$$
P_1 q_1 + P_2 q_2 = Y
$$

$$
20q_1 + 30q_2 = 600
$$

**Step 2:** The optimality condition requires that the marginal rate of substitution equals the price ratio:

$$
MRS = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
$$

For $U = q_1 \cdot q_2$:

$$
MU_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} = q_2, \quad MU_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} = q_1
$$

$$
\frac{q_2}{q_1} = \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

$$
q_2 = \frac{2}{3} q_1
$$

**Step 3:** Substitute into the budget constraint:

$$
20q_1 + 30 \cdot \frac{2}{3} q_1 = 600
$$

$$
20q_1 + 20q_1 = 600
$$

$$
40q_1 = 600
$$

$$
q_1^* = 15
$$

**Step 4:** Find $q_2^*$:

$$
q_2^* = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 15 = 10
$$

**Result:** The optimal basket is $q_1^* = 15$ and $q_2^* = 10$, yielding utility $U = 15 \times 10 = 150$.

  </Question>
  <Question text="A perfectly competitive firm should shut down in the short run when the price falls below:">
    <Option value="a">Average total cost (AC)</Option>
    <Option value="b" correct>Average variable cost (AVC)</Option>
    <Option value="c">Marginal cost (MC)</Option>
    <Option value="d">Average fixed cost (AFC)</Option>
  </Question>
  <Question text="Variable costs are zero when output is:">
    <Option value="a" correct>Zero</Option>
    <Option value="b">At its maximum</Option>
    <Option value="c">Equal to fixed costs</Option>
    <Option value="d">Variable costs are never zero</Option>
  </Question>
</Quiz>

### Worked Example: Cost Functions

**Problem:** A firm has total cost $TC = 100 + 5Q + 0.5Q^2$. Find FC, VC, AC, AVC, AFC, and MC.

<Collapse title="Step-by-step solution">

**Step 1:** Identify fixed and variable costs:

$$
FC = 100 \quad \text{(the constant term, independent of } Q\text{)}
$$

$$
VC = 5Q + 0.5Q^2 \quad \text{(all terms that depend on } Q\text{)}
$$

**Step 2:** Average costs (divide by $Q$):

$$
AC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{100}{Q} + 5 + 0.5Q
$$

$$
AVC = \frac{VC}{Q} = 5 + 0.5Q
$$

$$
AFC = \frac{FC}{Q} = \frac{100}{Q}
$$

**Step 3:** Marginal cost (derivative of TC with respect to $Q$):

$$
MC = \frac{dTC}{dQ} = 5 + Q
$$

**Numerical example** — at $Q = 10$:

| Measure | Formula | Value |
|---|---|---|
| TC | $100 + 5(10) + 0.5(100)$ | 200 |
| FC | 100 | 100 |
| VC | $5(10) + 0.5(100)$ | 100 |
| AC | $200 / 10$ | 20 |
| AVC | $100 / 10$ | 10 |
| AFC | $100 / 10$ | 10 |
| MC | $5 + 10$ | 15 |

Note that $AC = AVC + AFC = 10 + 10 = 20$ ✓
