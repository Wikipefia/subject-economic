# Business Cycle and Economic Policy

Modern economies do not grow in a straight line. Output fluctuates around its long-run trend, alternating between periods of expansion and contraction. Governments and central banks use **fiscal** and **monetary policy** to smooth these fluctuations — stabilizing output, employment, and the price level. This article covers the business cycle itself, the tools of stabilization policy, and the role of exchange rates and international payments.

<Callout type="info">
This is an advanced article that builds on **Unemployment and Inflation** and **Economic Indicators**. You should be comfortable with concepts like GDP, aggregate demand, and the Phillips curve before proceeding.
</Callout>

## Part I: The Business Cycle

### Definition

The **business cycle** refers to the fluctuations of **real GDP** around **potential GDP** over time. The **output gap** measures this deviation:

$$
\text{Output Gap} = Y - Y^* = \text{Actual GDP} - \text{Potential GDP}
$$

- **Positive output gap**: the economy is overheating (actual > potential)
- **Negative output gap**: the economy has slack (actual < potential)

### Phases of the Business Cycle

| Phase | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **Expansion** | Rising real GDP, falling unemployment, increasing investment, rising prices |
| **Peak** | Maximum output; economy at or above potential; inflationary pressures strongest |
| **Contraction (Recession)** | Falling real GDP, rising unemployment, declining investment, easing inflation |
| **Trough** | Minimum output; economy well below potential; unemployment at its highest |

<Callout type="warning">
A **recession** is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP. A **depression** is a deep, prolonged recession — there is no universally agreed threshold, but it implies severe output loss and high unemployment lasting years. **Stagnation** refers to a period of zero or near-zero economic growth.
</Callout>

### Types of Business Cycles

Economists have identified cycles of different durations driven by different underlying forces:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Kitchin Cycle">

**Duration**: 1–2 years (short cycle)

**Driver**: Changes in business **inventories**

- Firms build up inventories when demand is expected to grow, then reduce them when demand softens
- Creates short, frequent fluctuations in output

</Tab>
<Tab label="Juglar Cycle">

**Duration**: 8–10 years (medium cycle)

**Driver**: **Fixed capital investment** — machinery, equipment, buildings

- Firms invest heavily during expansions; investment collapses during downturns
- Closely associated with what we commonly call "the business cycle"
- Most recessions correspond to the Juglar cycle

</Tab>
<Tab label="Kondratiev Cycle">

**Duration**: 50–80 years (long wave)

**Driver**: **Technological innovation** and major structural transformations

- Each wave is associated with a transformative technology: steam engine → railroads → electricity → petrochemicals → information technology
- Controversial — some economists question whether these long waves truly exist as regular cycles

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Factors Affecting Potential Output

Potential GDP — the economy's long-run capacity — depends on:

- **Labor force** — population growth, immigration, participation rates
- **Technology** — innovation, research and development, productivity improvements
- **Natural resources** — land, minerals, energy endowments
- **Physical infrastructure** — transport, communications, energy networks
- **Human capital** — education, training, health of the workforce
- **Institutions** — rule of law, property rights, regulatory quality

<Callout type="info">
The business cycle is about **short-run fluctuations** around potential. Long-run growth — the gradual upward trend in potential GDP — is driven by the factors listed above.
</Callout>

## Part II: Fiscal Policy

### The State Budget

The **state budget** is the government's plan for revenue and expenditure over a fiscal year.

$$
\text{Budget Balance} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Expenditure}
$$

| Outcome | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Surplus** | Revenue > Expenditure |
| **Balanced budget** | Revenue ≈ Expenditure |
| **Deficit** | Revenue < Expenditure |

<Collapse title="Czech Republic budget deficits — key milestones">

The Czech state budget has experienced notable deficits during economic downturns:

- **2009**: Deficit of ~192 billion CZK during the Global Financial Crisis
- **2012–2013**: Continued fiscal consolidation, deficit narrowing
- **2016–2019**: Near-balanced budgets, even a small surplus in 2016
- **2020**: Deficit of ~367 billion CZK — pandemic-related spending (COVID support programs, Antivirus wage subsidies)
- **2021**: Deficit ~420 billion CZK — continued pandemic recovery spending
- **2022–2024**: Deficits remained elevated due to energy crisis support and inflation compensation measures

These figures illustrate how the business cycle and external shocks shape fiscal outcomes.

</Collapse>

### Government Revenue and Expenditure

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Revenue">

Government revenue comes from several sources:

**Direct taxes** (paid by the taxpayer directly):
- Personal income tax
- Corporate income tax

**Indirect taxes** (embedded in prices):
- Value Added Tax (VAT) — the largest single revenue source in CZ
- Excise duties (fuel, alcohol, tobacco)

**Other revenue**:
- Social security and health insurance contributions (compulsory)
- Customs duties
- Fees, fines, and state property income

</Tab>
<Tab label="Expenditure">

Government spending is categorized by flexibility:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory** | Required by law; cannot be reduced without legislative change | Pensions, social benefits, debt service |
| **Quasi-mandatory** | Committed through contracts or prior decisions | Investment incentives, EU co-financing |
| **Discretionary** | Decided annually in the budget process | Defense, infrastructure projects, education programs |

Mandatory spending constitutes the largest share — in the Czech Republic, over 50% of total expenditure.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Government Debt

Government debt is the **accumulated stock** of past deficits.

| Concept | Definition |
|---|---|
| **State debt** | Debt of the central government only |
| **Public debt** | Debt of all levels of government (central + local + state funds) |
| **Internal debt** | Owed to domestic creditors |
| **External debt** | Owed to foreign creditors |

**Czech Republic debt trajectory:**

The state debt has grown from **158.8 billion CZK in 1993** (after the split of Czechoslovakia) to over **2.4 trillion CZK by 2022**. Key debt instruments include:

- **Government bonds** (státní dluhopisy) — medium and long-term
- **Treasury bills** (státní pokladniční poukázky) — short-term
- **Savings bonds** for retail investors

<Timeline title="Czech Government Debt: Key Milestones">
  <TimelineEvent date="1993" title="After Czechoslovak Split">
    Initial state debt of 158.8 billion CZK following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.
  </TimelineEvent>
  <TimelineEvent date="2009" title="Global Financial Crisis">
    Budget deficit reaches ~192 billion CZK as tax revenues collapse and stimulus spending increases.
  </TimelineEvent>
  <TimelineEvent date="2016" title="Fiscal Consolidation">
    Near-balanced budget achieved; small surplus recorded thanks to strong economic growth.
  </TimelineEvent>
  <TimelineEvent date="2020" title="COVID-19 Pandemic">
    Deficit explodes to ~367 billion CZK — Antivirus wage subsidies and emergency pandemic spending.
  </TimelineEvent>
  <TimelineEvent date="2021" title="Continued Recovery Spending">
    Deficit reaches ~420 billion CZK as pandemic support programs continue.
  </TimelineEvent>
  <TimelineEvent date="2022" title="Energy Crisis">
    State debt surpasses 2.4 trillion CZK (~44% of GDP). Energy crisis support measures keep deficits elevated.
  </TimelineEvent>
</Timeline>

<Callout type="warning">
While Czech public debt as a share of GDP (~44% in 2022) remains below the EU average, the rapid growth during 2020–2022 raised concerns about fiscal sustainability. The Maastricht criterion sets a reference value of 60% of GDP.
</Callout>

### Fiscal Policy Tools

Fiscal policy uses government spending and taxation to influence aggregate demand:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Expansionary">

**Expansionary fiscal policy** aims to **stimulate** the economy during recessions:

- **Increase government spending** — infrastructure projects, subsidies, transfers
- **Cut taxes** — puts more disposable income in the hands of consumers and firms

**Effects:**
- Shifts AD rightward → higher output, lower unemployment
- But may **increase inflation** and **widen the budget deficit**
- Risk of **crowding out** — government borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment

$$
G \uparrow \text{ or } T \downarrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad AD \uparrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad Y \uparrow, \; u \downarrow, \; P \uparrow
$$

</Tab>
<Tab label="Restrictive">

**Restrictive (contractionary) fiscal policy** aims to **cool down** an overheating economy:

- **Cut government spending** — reduce programs, freeze hiring
- **Raise taxes** — reduces disposable income

**Effects:**
- Shifts AD leftward → lower output growth, reduced inflationary pressure
- But may **increase unemployment** in the short run
- Helps reduce budget deficits and stabilize debt

$$
G \downarrow \text{ or } T \uparrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad AD \downarrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad Y \downarrow, \; u \uparrow, \; P \downarrow
$$

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Automatic Stabilizers vs. Discretionary Policy

| Feature | Automatic Stabilizers | Discretionary Policy |
|---|---|---|
| **Activation** | Work automatically, no policy action needed | Requires deliberate government decisions |
| **Examples** | Progressive taxation, unemployment benefits | Stimulus packages, tax reform, public works |
| **Timing** | Immediate | Subject to recognition, decision, and implementation lags |
| **Countercyclical?** | Always | Can be, but political pressures may cause pro-cyclical policy |

**Progressive taxation** automatically stabilizes: in a boom, rising incomes push taxpayers into higher brackets, dampening demand. In a downturn, lower incomes reduce the tax burden, supporting spending.

**Unemployment benefits** automatically increase during recessions (more people qualify) and decrease during expansions — cushioning the business cycle.

---

## Part III: Monetary Policy

### The Central Bank

In the Czech Republic, the **Czech National Bank (ČNB — Česká národní banka)** conducts monetary policy.

Key features:
- **Independent** from the government — essential for credibility
- **Primary goal**: maintaining **price stability**
- Uses **inflation targeting** since 1998 — currently targeting **2% CPI inflation** with a ±1 percentage point tolerance band

<Callout type="info">
Central bank independence is critical. If the government controlled the money supply, it might be tempted to print money to finance deficits — leading to inflation. Independence allows the central bank to focus on long-term price stability.
</Callout>

### Monetary Policy Instruments

#### Direct Instruments

Direct instruments regulate banks by command:
- **Credit regulation** — limits on credit growth
- **Liquidity rules** — minimum liquidity ratios
- **Credit ceilings** — maximum lending amounts

These are rarely used in modern market economies but may be employed in exceptional circumstances.

#### Indirect Instruments

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Required Minimum Reserves (PMR)">

Banks must hold a minimum fraction of deposits at the central bank as reserves.

- In the Czech Republic: **2% since 1999**
- Increasing PMR → banks have less to lend → money supply contracts
- Decreasing PMR → banks can lend more → money supply expands

This tool is used infrequently due to its blunt impact on the banking system.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Open Market Operations">

The central bank buys or sells securities (typically government bonds) to influence the money supply and short-term interest rates.

- **ČNB's main tool**: the **2-week repo rate** (2T repo sazba)
- ČNB conducts 2-week **repo tenders** — commercial banks deposit excess liquidity at the ČNB at the repo rate
- Increasing the repo rate → higher cost of money → contractionary
- Decreasing the repo rate → lower cost of money → expansionary

This is the **primary instrument** of modern monetary policy.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Discount Rate">

The **discount rate** (diskontní sazba) is the interest rate the central bank pays on overnight deposits from commercial banks.

- It forms the **floor** of the interest rate corridor
- Banks will not lend to each other at rates below the discount rate (they would rather deposit at the ČNB)
- Typically the lowest of the three main rates

</Tab>
<Tab label="Lombard Rate">

The **Lombard rate** (lombardní sazba) is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks against **collateral** (typically government bonds).

- It forms the **ceiling** of the interest rate corridor
- Banks will not borrow from each other above this rate (they can borrow from the ČNB instead)
- Typically the highest of the three main rates

</Tab>
<Tab label="FX Interventions">

The central bank can buy or sell foreign currency to influence the exchange rate:

- **Buying foreign currency** (selling CZK) → weakens the koruna → stimulates exports and increases inflation
- **Selling foreign currency** (buying CZK) → strengthens the koruna → reduces import prices and inflation

**Notable example**: The ČNB maintained a currency floor of 27 CZK/EUR from November 2013 to April 2017 as an unconventional tool to prevent deflation when the policy rate had hit zero.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Expansionary vs. Restrictive Monetary Policy

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Expansionary">

**Goal**: Stimulate the economy during recession

**Actions**: Lower interest rates, increase money supply

**Transmission**:

$$
i \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; \text{Lending} \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; I \uparrow, C \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; AD \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; Y \uparrow, \; P \uparrow
$$

Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper → firms invest more, consumers spend more → aggregate demand increases → output rises but so does inflation.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Restrictive">

**Goal**: Cool down an overheating economy, control inflation

**Actions**: Raise interest rates, reduce money supply

**Transmission**:

$$
i \uparrow \;\Rightarrow\; \text{Lending} \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; I \downarrow, C \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; AD \downarrow \;\Rightarrow\; Y \downarrow, \; P \downarrow
$$

Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive → investment and consumption fall → aggregate demand decreases → inflation is brought under control, but output may decline.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Transmission Mechanism

The path from central bank action to the real economy:

1. **Central bank sets the policy rate** (repo rate)
2. → Affects **interbank market rates** (PRIBOR in CZ)
3. → Influences **commercial bank rates** on loans and deposits
4. → Changes **lending and saving decisions** of firms and households
5. → Shifts **aggregate demand**
6. → Ultimately affects **real GDP and inflation**

<Callout type="info">
**Monetary neutrality**: In the long run, changes in the money supply affect only the **price level**, not real output. Money is "neutral" in the long run — it only changes nominal variables (prices, wages) without affecting real variables (output, employment). This is why central banks focus on price stability.

## Part IV: Exchange Rates and International Finance

### Exchange Rate Basics

The **exchange rate** is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.

| Term | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct quotation** | Units of domestic currency per 1 unit of foreign currency | 25 CZK/EUR |
| **Indirect quotation** | Units of foreign currency per 1 unit of domestic currency | 0.04 EUR/CZK |
| **Appreciation** | Domestic currency gains value (in a flexible regime) | CZK goes from 25 to 24 per EUR |
| **Depreciation** | Domestic currency loses value (in a flexible regime) | CZK goes from 25 to 26 per EUR |
| **Revaluation** | Official strengthening (in a fixed regime) | — |
| **Devaluation** | Official weakening (in a fixed regime) | — |

The Czech Republic operates a **managed float** — the exchange rate is determined by the market, but the ČNB may intervene in exceptional circumstances.

### Impact on Trade and Inflation

| Depreciation of CZK | Appreciation of CZK |
|---|---|
| Czech exports become **cheaper** for foreigners → exports rise | Czech exports become **more expensive** → exports fall |
| Imports become **more expensive** for Czech consumers → imports fall | Imports become **cheaper** → imports rise |
| **Inflationary** — higher import prices push up CPI | **Deflationary** — lower import prices reduce CPI |
| Improves trade balance (in the short/medium run) | Worsens trade balance |

### Maastricht Convergence Criteria

For a country to adopt the euro, it must meet the Maastricht criteria:

1. **Price stability** — inflation rate no more than 1.5 pp above the three best-performing EU members
2. **Sustainable public finances** — budget deficit ≤ 3% of GDP and public debt ≤ 60% of GDP
3. **Exchange rate stability** — participation in ERM II for at least 2 years without severe tensions
4. **Long-term interest rates** — no more than 2 pp above the three best-performing members on price stability

<Callout type="info">
The Czech Republic has **not yet set a target date** for euro adoption. While it meets most criteria technically, political will has been limited and public opinion is largely opposed.
</Callout>

### Balance of Payments

The **balance of payments** records all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world over a period.

| Account | Components |
|---|---|
| **Current Account** | Trade balance (goods), services, primary income (wages, investment income), secondary income (transfers) |
| **Capital Account** | Capital transfers, acquisition/disposal of non-produced assets |
| **Financial Account** | Foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, other investment, reserve assets |

$$
\text{Current Account} + \text{Capital Account} + \text{Financial Account} = 0
$$

The balance of payments always balances in an **accounting sense** — any current account deficit must be financed by a surplus in the financial account (capital inflows).

<Collapse title="Czech Republic balance of payments overview">

Key features of the Czech balance of payments:

- **Current account**: Historically in deficit, driven by repatriation of profits by foreign-owned companies (primary income outflows). The trade balance in goods has improved significantly since EU accession.
- **Financial account**: Large FDI inflows, especially in the 1990s–2000s (privatization, greenfield investments by multinational firms — Škoda/VW, Hyundai, etc.).
- **Reserve assets**: Grew substantially during the 2013–2017 currency intervention period as the ČNB accumulated foreign exchange.
