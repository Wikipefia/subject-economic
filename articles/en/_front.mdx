# General Economics: Course Overview

General Economics provides a comprehensive foundation in both **microeconomics** and **macroeconomics** — the two pillars of modern economic thought. The course examines how economic agents make decisions, how markets function, and how national economies perform and are managed.

## Why This Course Matters

Economic thinking is essential for understanding the world around us:

- **Supply and demand** explain how prices form and how markets allocate scarce resources
- **Consumer theory** reveals why people make the choices they do under budget constraints
- **Production and cost analysis** helps firms optimize output and minimize waste
- **Market structures** determine competition, pricing power, and innovation incentives
- **GDP and inflation** measure the health and trajectory of entire economies
- **Economic policy** shapes employment, growth, and stability through fiscal and monetary tools

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three thematic tiers plus a practice section:

### Foundations
Start here. These articles build the essential vocabulary and reasoning tools:
- **Introduction to Economics** — economic subjects, production factors, economic systems
- **Demand, Supply, and the Market** — demand and supply functions, elasticity, market equilibrium

### Microeconomics
Individual agents and firms:
- **Consumer Utility Theory** — utility, indifference curves, budget constraints, consumer optimum
- **Production and Costs** — production functions, short-run and long-run costs, returns to scale
- **Market Structures** — perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly

### Macroeconomics
The economy as a whole:
- **Economic Performance Indicators** — GDP, GNP, NDP, methods of measurement
- **Unemployment and Inflation** — types, causes, Phillips curve, CPI
- **Business Cycle and Economic Policy** — fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rates

### Practice
Hands-on problem solving with interactive exercises:
- **Practice Problems** — quizzes, worked examples, and calculation challenges

## Prerequisites

No prior economics knowledge is required. Basic algebra and an understanding of graphs (coordinates, slopes) will be helpful for the mathematical formulations.

## Instructor

This course is taught by **doc. Kopecký**. See the instructor profile for office hours and contact information.
