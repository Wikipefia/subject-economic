# Discrete Mathematics: Course Overview

Discrete Mathematics forms the mathematical backbone of computer science. Unlike continuous mathematics (calculus, analysis), discrete math deals with **countable, distinct structures** — the kind of math that computers actually operate on.

## Why This Course Matters

Every algorithm you write, every data structure you use, every database query you execute — they all rest on discrete mathematical foundations:

- **Logic** powers boolean expressions, circuit design, and formal verification
- **Set Theory** underpins type systems, databases, and category theory
- **Combinatorics** drives algorithm analysis and probability
- **Graph Theory** models networks, dependencies, and state machines
- **Number Theory** secures cryptographic systems

## Course Structure

The course is organized into three tiers:

### Foundations
Start here. These articles build the core vocabulary and reasoning tools you'll use throughout the course:
- **Introduction to Discrete Math** — propositional logic, sets, proof techniques
- **Core Concepts** — relations, functions, combinatorial counting

### Advanced Topics
Deeper theory with real-world applications:
- **Advanced Topics** — graph theory, recurrence relations, generating functions

### Practice
Hands-on problem solving with interactive exercises:
- **Practice Problems** — quizzes, coding challenges, worked examples

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of high school algebra and mathematical notation. No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with Python is helpful for the code examples.

## Instructors

This course is taught by **Prof. Ivan Petrov** and **Dr. Maria Nováková**. See their profiles for office hours and contact information.
