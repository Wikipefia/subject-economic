# Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

Discrete mathematics studies mathematical structures that are fundamentally **discrete** — not continuous. Where calculus deals with smooth curves and infinitesimal changes, discrete math works with distinct, separated values: integers, graphs, logical statements.

## Propositional Logic

A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both.

| Proposition | Truth Value |
|---|---|
| "2 + 2 = 4" | True |
| "The Earth is flat" | False |
| "Is it raining?" | Not a proposition (question) |
| "x + 1 = 5" | Not a proposition (depends on x) |

### Logical Connectives

Propositions can be combined using logical connectives:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="AND (∧)">
The conjunction $p \land q$ is true only when **both** $p$ and $q$ are true.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \land q$ |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |
</Tab>

<Tab label="OR (∨)">
The disjunction $p \lor q$ is true when **at least one** of $p$ or $q$ is true.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \lor q$ |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | T |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | F |
</Tab>

<Tab label="NOT (¬)">
The negation $\lnot p$ flips the truth value.

| $p$ | $\lnot p$ |
|---|---|
| T | F |
| F | T |
</Tab>

<Tab label="IMPLIES (→)">
The implication $p \to q$ is false **only** when $p$ is true and $q$ is false.

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \to q$ |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

> The "vacuously true" cases (when $p$ is false) are often counterintuitive at first!
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### De Morgan's Laws

Two fundamental equivalences for negating compound statements:

$$
\lnot(p \land q) \equiv (\lnot p) \lor (\lnot q)
$$

$$
\lnot(p \lor q) \equiv (\lnot p) \land (\lnot q)
$$

<Callout type="warning">
De Morgan's Laws are used **everywhere** in programming. When you negate a compound `if` condition, you're applying De Morgan's. Getting this wrong is one of the most common sources of logic bugs.
</Callout>

## Set Theory Basics

A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects called **elements** or **members**.

### Notation

```python
# Python sets mirror mathematical set notation
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

# Membership
print(3 in A)       # True  (3 ∈ A)
print(6 in A)       # False (6 ∉ A)

# Set operations
union = A | B        # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  (A ∪ B)
intersection = A & B # {3, 4, 5}               (A ∩ B)
difference = A - B   # {1, 2}                  (A \ B)
sym_diff = A ^ B     # {1, 2, 6, 7}           (A △ B)

print(f"A ∪ B = {union}")
print(f"A ∩ B = {intersection}")
print(f"A \\ B = {difference}")
```

### Cardinality

The **cardinality** of a set $A$, written $|A|$, is the number of elements it contains.

For finite sets $A$ and $B$, the **inclusion-exclusion principle** states:

$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
$$

<Collapse title="Proof of Inclusion-Exclusion for Two Sets">

**Proof.** Partition $A \cup B$ into three disjoint regions:
1. Elements in $A$ only: $A \setminus B$
2. Elements in $B$ only: $B \setminus A$
3. Elements in both: $A \cap B$

Then:
$$|A \cup B| = |A \setminus B| + |B \setminus A| + |A \cap B|$$

Since $|A| = |A \setminus B| + |A \cap B|$, we get $|A \setminus B| = |A| - |A \cap B|$.

Similarly, we have $|B \setminus A| = |B| - |A \cap B|$.

Substituting:
$$|A \cup B| = (|A| - |A \cap B|) + (|B| - |A \cap B|) + |A \cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

## Proof Techniques

Mathematical proofs are the currency of discrete mathematics. Here are the main techniques:

### Direct Proof

To prove $p \to q$: assume $p$ is true, then show $q$ follows.

$$
\text{Theorem: If } n \text{ is even, then } n^2 \text{ is even.}
$$

**Proof.** Let $n$ be even. Then $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Therefore $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$, which is even. $\blacksquare$

### Proof by Contradiction

To prove $p$: assume $\lnot p$, then derive a contradiction.

<Collapse title="Example: √2 is irrational (classic proof by contradiction)">

**Proof.** Suppose, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are integers with no common factors.

Squaring both sides: $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $a^2 = 2b^2$.

This means $a^2$ is even, so $a$ must be even. Write $a = 2c$.

Then $(2c)^2 = 2b^2$, giving $4c^2 = 2b^2$, so $b^2 = 2c^2$.

This means $b$ is also even — contradicting our assumption that $a$ and $b$ share no common factors. $\blacksquare$
</Collapse>

### Proof by Induction

To prove a statement $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq n_0$:
1. **Base case**: Show $P(n_0)$ is true
2. **Inductive step**: Show that $P(k) \to P(k+1)$ for all $k \geq n_0$

<Callout type="info">
Mathematical induction is like dominoes: knock the first one over (base case), and show that each domino knocks over the next (inductive step). All dominoes fall.
</Callout>

**Example**: Prove that $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for all $n \geq 1$.

```python
def sum_formula(n: int) -> int:
    """Closed-form sum: 1 + 2 + ... + n"""
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Verify for several values
for n in range(1, 11):
    brute_force = sum(range(1, n + 1))
    formula = sum_formula(n)
    assert brute_force == formula, f"Mismatch at n={n}"
    print(f"n={n:2d}: sum = {formula}")
```
