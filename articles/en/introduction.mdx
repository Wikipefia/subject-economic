# Introduction to Economics

Economics is a **social science** that studies the behavior of economic subjects and the allocation of **scarce resources** to satisfy unlimited human wants. Before diving deeper, it is essential to distinguish between two closely related but distinct concepts.

<Callout type="info">
This is a foundational article. No prerequisites are needed — start here if you are new to the course.
</Callout>

## Economics vs. Economy

These two terms are often confused, but they refer to very different things:

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Economics** (ekonomie) | The *science* — a systematic body of knowledge studying how societies allocate scarce resources | "She studies economics at university." |
| **Economy** (ekonomika) | The *system* — the actual set of production, distribution, and consumption activities in a given territory | "The Czech economy grew by 2.5% last year." |

Economics is the discipline that *studies* the economy. The economy is the *object* being studied.

<Definition term="Economics (ekonomie)">
A social science studying how societies allocate **scarce resources** to satisfy unlimited wants. It analyzes the behavior of individuals, firms, and governments, and the outcomes of their market interactions.
</Definition>

<Callout type="warning">
Do not confuse these two! On exams, mixing up "economics" (the science) with "economy" (the real system) is a common mistake.
</Callout>

## Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics

Modern economics is divided into two broad branches:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Microeconomics">

**Microeconomics** studies the behavior of **individual economic subjects** — consumers, firms, and specific markets.

Key topics include:
- **Demand and supply** on individual markets
- **Consumer choice** and utility maximization
- **Firm behavior** — production, costs, profit maximization
- **Market structures** — perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly
- **Price formation** on goods and factor markets

Microeconomics asks: *How does a single consumer decide what to buy? How does a firm set its price?*

</Tab>
<Tab label="Macroeconomics">

**Macroeconomics** studies the economy **as a whole** — aggregate output, price levels, and national economic policy.

Key topics include:
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** and economic growth
- **Inflation** and the general price level
- **Unemployment** and the labor market in aggregate
- **Monetary policy** — central bank, interest rates, money supply
- **Fiscal policy** — government spending, taxation, budget deficits

Macroeconomics asks: *Why do recessions happen? How can the government stimulate the economy?*

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Positive vs. Normative Economics

Economics can be approached in two fundamentally different ways:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Positive Economics">

**Positive economics** is concerned with **objective description** — what the economy *is* and how it *works*. It makes statements that can be tested, verified, or refuted with data.

Examples of positive statements:
- "If the minimum wage increases by 10%, youth unemployment rises by 2%."
- "Inflation in the Czech Republic was 2.8% in 2024."
- "A decrease in interest rates leads to increased investment spending."

Positive economics does not make value judgments — it describes reality as it is.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Normative Economics">

**Normative economics** involves **value judgments** — what the economy *should be* or what policies *ought to be* pursued. These statements cannot be proven true or false by data alone.

Examples of normative statements:
- "The government should raise the minimum wage to reduce poverty."
- "Taxes on the wealthy should be higher."
- "Free trade is better than protectionism."

Normative economics reflects personal, political, or ethical preferences.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
**How to tell them apart**: If a statement contains words like "should," "ought to," or "better," it is likely normative. If it describes a measurable relationship, it is positive.
</Callout>

## Economic Subjects

An **economic subject** is any entity that makes economic decisions. The four main types are:

### 1. Households (Consumers)

Households are the fundamental consuming units of the economy:
- They **own production factors** (labor, land, capital) and supply them to firms
- They **receive income** — wages for labor, rent for land, interest/dividends for capital
- They may receive **government transfers** (pensions, social benefits)
- They **pay taxes** to the state
- They **consume** goods and services to maximize utility

### 2. Firms (Producers)

Firms transform inputs into outputs:
- They **hire production factors** from households
- They **produce goods and services** for the market
- They **earn revenue** from selling their output
- They **pay costs** — wages, rent, interest, raw materials
- Their goal is typically to **maximize profit**

### 3. State / Government

The state plays multiple roles in the economy:
- **Provides public goods** (national defense, infrastructure, public education)
- **Creates the legislative framework** — laws, regulations, property rights
- **Conducts fiscal policy** — taxation and government spending
- **Redistributes income** through transfers and progressive taxation
- **Corrects market failures** — externalities, monopoly regulation

### 4. Foreign Sector

The foreign sector captures international economic interactions:

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Closed economy** | No trade with other countries (theoretical) |
| **Open economy** | Engages in international trade — exports and imports |
| **Exports** | Goods and services sold to foreign buyers |
| **Imports** | Goods and services purchased from abroad |
| **Net exports** | Exports minus imports ($NX = X - M$) |

<Callout type="info">
In practice, all modern economies are **open economies**. The closed-economy model is useful only as a theoretical simplification.
</Callout>

## Basic Production Factors

Production factors are the inputs used to create goods and services. There are three primary factors:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Labor">

**Labor** is the purposeful human activity directed at producing goods and services.

- It is a **primary factor** — it exists independently of prior production
- The **price of labor** is the **wage** (mzda)
- Labor quality depends on education, skills, experience, and health
- The labor market is where supply of labor (from households) meets demand for labor (from firms)

</Tab>
<Tab label="Land">

**Land** encompasses all **natural resources** used in production.

- Includes agricultural land, forests, minerals, water, air
- It is a **primary factor** — provided by nature, not produced
- The **price of land** is **rent** (renta)
- Land is typically characterized by a fixed or very limited supply

</Tab>
<Tab label="Capital">

**Capital** refers to produced means of production — tools, machinery, buildings, technology.

- It is a **secondary (derived) factor** — the result of prior production processes
- The **price of capital** is **interest** or **rent** (úrok, renta)
- Capital must be accumulated through investment (saving and producing capital goods)
- Physical capital (machines) is distinct from financial capital (money, stocks)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Collapse title="Additional detail: Human capital and entrepreneurship">

Some economists identify additional factors:

- **Human capital** — the knowledge, skills, and abilities embodied in workers. It is built through education and training and increases labor productivity.
- **Entrepreneurship** — the ability to organize the other factors, take risks, and innovate. The entrepreneur's reward is **profit**.

These are sometimes considered extensions of labor and capital rather than fully separate factors.

</Collapse>

## The Market

A **market** is any arrangement where buyers and sellers interact to exchange goods, services, or production factors. It is the central mechanism through which economic questions are answered in market economies.

### Types of Markets

| Market Type | What is traded | Demanders | Suppliers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goods and services market** | Final products | Households | Firms |
| **Factor market (labor)** | Labor services | Firms | Households |
| **Factor market (capital)** | Financial capital, machinery | Firms | Households / other firms |
| **Factor market (land)** | Land and natural resources | Firms | Landowners |

### The Role of Money

Money serves as a **medium of exchange**, eliminating the inefficiency of barter. It fulfills three functions:

1. **Medium of exchange** — accepted in payment for goods and services
2. **Unit of account** — provides a common measure of value
3. **Store of value** — allows purchasing power to be saved for the future

<Callout type="info">
Markets can exist without money (barter), but money dramatically reduces **transaction costs** and enables complex economic exchange.
</Callout>

## Basic Economic Questions

Every society must answer three fundamental questions:

1. **What to produce?** — Which goods and services, in what quantities?
2. **How to produce?** — With which technologies, combinations of factors?
3. **For whom to produce?** — How is output distributed among members of society?

<Comparison title="Economic Systems at a Glance">
  <ComparisonItem title="Market Economy">

Decisions by **individual agents** via the price mechanism. Supply and demand allocate resources. *Adam Smith's "invisible hand."*

  </ComparisonItem>
  <ComparisonItem title="Planned Economy">

A **central authority** makes all production and distribution decisions. State ownership of means of production.

  </ComparisonItem>
  <ComparisonItem title="Mixed Economy">

**Combination** of market mechanisms and government intervention. Most real-world economies today.

  </ComparisonItem>
</Comparison>

Different economic systems answer these questions in different ways:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Market Economy">

Decisions are made by **individual agents** through the price mechanism. Supply and demand determine what is produced, how, and for whom.

- **Advantages**: efficiency, innovation, consumer choice
- **Disadvantages**: inequality, market failures, instability
- **Key thinker**: Adam Smith — the "invisible hand"

</Tab>
<Tab label="Centrally Planned Economy">

A **central authority** (typically the state) makes all production and distribution decisions.

- **Advantages**: can address inequality, mobilize resources for national goals
- **Disadvantages**: inefficiency, lack of incentives, information problems
- **Historical examples**: Soviet Union, pre-reform China

</Tab>
<Tab label="Customary Economy">

Economic decisions follow **tradition and custom**, passed down through generations.

- Found in subsistence communities and indigenous societies
- Production methods, roles, and distribution are determined by cultural norms
- Very limited in the modern world

</Tab>
<Tab label="Mixed Economy">

Most real-world economies are **mixed** — combining market mechanisms with government intervention.

- The private sector operates through markets
- The government regulates, taxes, provides public goods, and redistributes
- **Examples**: most European countries, USA, Japan, Czech Republic

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Circular Flow of the Economy

The interactions between economic subjects can be visualized as a **circular flow**:

1. **Households** supply production factors (labor, land, capital) to **firms** through factor markets
2. **Firms** pay income to households (wages, rent, interest, profit)
3. **Households** spend income on goods and services from firms through product markets
4. **Firms** receive revenue from these sales
5. The **government** collects taxes, provides public goods, and makes transfers
6. The **foreign sector** participates via exports and imports

$$
\text{Total Income} = \text{Total Expenditure} = \text{Total Output (GDP)}
$$

<Callout type="info">
This identity — that total income equals total spending equals total output — is one of the most fundamental ideas in macroeconomics and forms the basis of national accounts.
</Callout>
