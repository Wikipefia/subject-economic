# Economic Performance Indicators

How do we measure the health of an entire economy? Unlike a firm's balance sheet, a nation's economic performance requires aggregate indicators that capture the total output, income, and spending of millions of agents. The most important of these is **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**.

<Callout type="info">
Macroeconomics begins with measurement. Before we can analyze business cycles, design policy, or compare countries, we need reliable indicators of economic performance. This article covers the key measures and models.
</Callout>

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

<Definition term="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)">
The total market value of all **final goods and services** produced within a country's borders during a given time period. It is the most widely used measure of a nation's economic output.
</Definition>

**GDP** is the total market value of all **final goods and services** produced within a country's borders during a given time period (usually one year or one quarter).

Key points in the definition:

- **Market value**: goods and services valued at their market prices
- **Final**: only finished products, not intermediate goods (to avoid double counting)
- **Within the country**: geographic criterion (domestic), regardless of who owns the factors of production
- **Given time period**: a flow variable, not a stock

### Nominal vs Real GDP

- **Nominal GDP**: measured at **current** (actual) prices of each year

$$
\text{Nominal GDP}_t = \sum_{i} P_{i,t} \cdot Q_{i,t}
$$

- **Real GDP**: measured at **constant** (base-year) prices, removing the effect of inflation

$$
\text{Real GDP}_t = \sum_{i} P_{i,\text{base}} \cdot Q_{i,t}
$$

<Callout type="warning">
Always use **real GDP** when comparing economic performance across time. Nominal GDP can grow simply because prices rise (inflation), even if actual production is unchanged.
</Callout>

### GDP Deflator

The **GDP deflator** measures the overall price level of domestically produced goods and services:

$$
\text{GDP Deflator} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100
$$

Unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator covers **all** domestically produced goods (not just a consumer basket) and uses **current** quantity weights (Paasche-type index).

## Three Methods of GDP Measurement

GDP can be measured from three equivalent perspectives. In theory, all three yield the same result.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Production (Output) Method">

Sums the **value added** at each stage of production across all sectors of the economy.

$$
\text{GDP} = \sum_{\text{sectors}} (\text{Output} - \text{Intermediate Consumption})
$$

**Value added** = the value a firm adds to inputs through its production process.

**Example**: A farmer grows wheat (value: 10 CZK), a miller makes flour (value: 25 CZK), a baker makes bread (value: 40 CZK).

| Stage | Output | Intermediate Input | Value Added |
|---|---|---|---|
| Farming | 10 CZK | 0 CZK | 10 CZK |
| Milling | 25 CZK | 10 CZK | 15 CZK |
| Baking | 40 CZK | 25 CZK | 15 CZK |
| **Total** | | | **40 CZK** |

The total value added (40 CZK) equals the price of the final good — no double counting.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Expenditure Method">

Sums all spending on final goods and services:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + NX
$$

where:
- $C$ = **Consumption** — household spending on goods and services
- $I$ = **Investment** — business spending on capital goods, residential construction, and inventory changes
- $G$ = **Government spending** — public expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfer payments)
- $NX$ = **Net exports** = Exports $-$ Imports

| Component | Czech Republic Share (approx.) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| $C$ | ~47% | Household final consumption |
| $I$ | ~26% | Gross capital formation |
| $G$ | ~20% | Government final consumption |
| $NX$ | ~+7% | Trade surplus (CZ is a net exporter) |

<Callout type="info">
The Czech Republic consistently runs a **trade surplus**, meaning exports exceed imports. This is driven by the strong manufacturing sector (especially automotive — Škoda Auto).
</Callout>
</Tab>

<Tab label="Income Method">

Sums all incomes earned in the production of GDP:

$$
\text{GDP} = W + R + i + \Pi + D + T_{\text{ind}}
$$

where:
- $W$ = **Wages and salaries** (compensation of employees)
- $R$ = **Rents** (income from land and property)
- $i$ = **Interest** (income from capital)
- $\Pi$ = **Profits** (corporate and proprietor income)
- $D$ = **Depreciation** (capital consumption allowance)
- $T_{\text{ind}}$ = **Indirect taxes** minus subsidies (net production taxes)

This method reflects that every dollar spent on a product must become someone's income.

## Related National Income Indicators

GDP is just one of several aggregate measures. Here is how they relate:

| Indicator | Formula |
|---|---|
| **GNP** (Gross National Product) | $\text{GDP} + \text{Net factor income from abroad}$ |
| **NDP** (Net Domestic Product) | $\text{GDP} - \text{Depreciation}$ |
| **NNP** (Net National Product) | $\text{GNP} - \text{Depreciation}$ |
| **National Income (NI)** | $\text{NNP} - \text{Indirect taxes} + \text{Subsidies}$ |
| **Personal Income (PI)** | $\text{NI} - \text{Retained profits} - \text{Social contributions} + \text{Transfers}$ |
| **Disposable Income (DI)** | $\text{PI} - \text{Personal taxes}$ |

<Collapse title="GNP vs GDP: What's the Difference?">

**GDP** measures production by geographic location (within the country's borders).

**GNP** measures production by nationality of factors (by a country's residents, wherever they are located).

$$
\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + \text{Net Factor Income from Abroad}
$$

**Net factor income from abroad** = income earned by domestic residents abroad minus income earned by foreign residents domestically.

**Example**: A Czech worker in Germany earns wages that count toward Czech **GNP** but German **GDP**. A German-owned factory in Czechia generates profits that count toward Czech **GDP** but German **GNP**.

For most countries, the difference between GDP and GNP is small. For countries with large remittance flows (e.g., Philippines) or significant foreign investment (e.g., Ireland), the difference can be substantial.
</Collapse>

## GDP Growth Rate

The **real GDP growth rate** is the primary indicator of economic expansion or contraction:

$$
g = \frac{\text{GDP}_t - \text{GDP}_{t-1}}{\text{GDP}_{t-1}} \times 100\%
$$

The two sharpest declines in Czech GDP since independence were the **2009 financial crisis** ($-4.7\%$) and the **2020 COVID pandemic** ($-5.5\%$). Both were driven by external shocks — global financial contagion and a worldwide health emergency.

## Limitations of GDP

GDP is a powerful but imperfect measure. It fails to capture several important dimensions of economic welfare:

| Limitation | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Informal economy** | Black market, unreported cash work — not measured |
| **Household production** | Childcare, cooking, home repairs done by household members — excluded |
| **Environmental damage** | Pollution, resource depletion — not subtracted; cleanup spending actually *adds* to GDP |
| **Quality of life** | Leisure time, health, personal safety — not reflected |
| **Inequality** | GDP per capita says nothing about distribution of income |
| **Non-market activities** | Volunteer work, open-source software — excluded |

### Alternative Measures

<Tabs>
<Tab label="HDI (Human Development Index)">

The **HDI**, developed by the UN (UNDP), combines three dimensions:

1. **Health**: Life expectancy at birth
2. **Education**: Mean and expected years of schooling
3. **Standard of living**: GNI per capita (PPP)

HDI ranges from 0 to 1. The Czech Republic scores approximately **0.889** (2023), ranking in the "very high human development" category.

## Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

The **AD-AS model** is the foundational framework for analyzing macroeconomic fluctuations and policy.

### Aggregate Demand (AD)

The AD curve shows the total quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level. It slopes **downward** in the price level ($P$) — real output ($Y$) space.

**Why AD slopes downward:**

1. **Wealth effect (Pigou effect)**: Higher $P$ → lower real wealth → less consumption
2. **Interest rate effect (Keynes effect)**: Higher $P$ → higher money demand → higher interest rates → less investment
3. **Exchange rate effect**: Higher $P$ → domestic goods more expensive → fewer exports, more imports → lower $NX$

**Shifts in AD**: Changes in any component of $C + I + G + NX$ that are not caused by the price level:

- Increase in consumer confidence → AD shifts right
- Increase in government spending → AD shifts right
- Contractionary monetary policy (higher interest rates) → AD shifts left

### Aggregate Supply (AS)

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Short-Run AS (SRAS)">

The SRAS curve slopes **upward**: as the price level rises, firms are willing to supply more output (in the short run) because some input prices (especially wages) are **sticky** — they adjust slowly.

$$
Y = Y^* + \alpha(P - P^e)
$$

where $Y^*$ is potential output, $P$ is actual price level, $P^e$ is expected price level, and $\alpha > 0$.

**Shifts in SRAS**: Changes in input costs, supply shocks (oil price spike shifts SRAS left), technology improvements (shift SRAS right).
</Tab>

<Tab label="Long-Run AS (LRAS)">

The LRAS curve is **vertical** at the level of **potential output** $Y^*$. In the long run, all prices and wages fully adjust, so the price level does not affect real output.

$$
Y = Y^* \quad \text{(regardless of } P \text{)}
$$

Potential output is determined by the economy's productive capacity: labor force, capital stock, technology, institutions.

**Shifts in LRAS**: Economic growth (capital accumulation, technological progress, labor force growth) shifts LRAS right.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### AD-AS Equilibrium

Short-run equilibrium occurs where $AD$ intersects $SRAS$. Long-run equilibrium additionally requires the intersection to be on the $LRAS$ curve (at potential output).

- **If actual output > potential output** (AD intersects SRAS to the right of LRAS): inflationary gap → wages rise → SRAS shifts left → economy returns to $Y^*$ at higher price level
- **If actual output < potential output** (AD intersects SRAS to the left of LRAS): recessionary gap → wages fall → SRAS shifts right → economy returns to $Y^*$ at lower price level

## Potential Output and the Output Gap

### Potential Output

**Potential GDP** ($Y^*$) is the level of output the economy can produce when all resources are used at their **normal** (sustainable) rates — full employment of labor and capital, without generating inflationary or deflationary pressure.

<Callout type="info">
Potential output does **not** mean maximum output. It is the level consistent with stable inflation — the economy's long-run sustainable capacity.
</Callout>

### Output Gap

The **output gap** measures the difference between actual and potential GDP:

$$
\text{Output Gap} = Y - Y^* = \text{Actual GDP} - \text{Potential GDP}
$$

| Output Gap | Sign | Name | Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| $Y > Y^*$ | Positive | **Inflationary (expansionary) gap** | Economy overheating, rising inflation, low unemployment |
| $Y = Y^*$ | Zero | **At potential** | Stable inflation, natural rate of unemployment |
| $Y < Y^*$ | Negative | **Recessionary (deflationary) gap** | Idle resources, high unemployment, downward pressure on prices |

<Collapse title="Estimating Potential Output in Practice">

Potential output is not directly observable — it must be estimated. Common methods include:

1. **Production function approach**: Estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function $Y^* = A \cdot K^\alpha \cdot L^{1-\alpha}$ using trend values of productivity ($A$), capital ($K$), and labor ($L$).

2. **HP filter (Hodrick-Prescott)**: A statistical technique that extracts a smooth trend from actual GDP data.

3. **NAIRU-based**: Estimate the output level consistent with the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.

The Czech National Bank (ČNB) and the European Commission regularly publish estimates of the Czech output gap.
