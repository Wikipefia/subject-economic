# Production and Costs

Understanding how firms produce output and the costs they incur is central to microeconomics. This article covers **production functions**, **cost structures**, **revenue concepts**, and the conditions under which firms **maximize profit**.

<Callout type="info">
This article assumes familiarity with basic market concepts. Make sure you have read [Introduction to Economics](/general-economics/introduction) and [Demand, Supply, and the Market](/general-economics/demand-supply-market) first.
</Callout>

## The Production Function

A **production function** describes the relationship between inputs (factors of production) and the maximum output a firm can produce:

$$
Q = f(K, L)
$$

where $Q$ is quantity of output, $K$ is capital, and $L$ is labor.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Short Run">

In the **short run**, at least one factor of production is **fixed** — typically capital $K$. The firm can only adjust its variable input (labor $L$).

- The firm operates with a given plant size, set of machines, or factory
- Only labor can be increased or decreased
- The production function becomes: $Q = f(\bar{K}, L)$

</Tab>
<Tab label="Long Run">

In the **long run**, **all** factors of production are **variable**. The firm can adjust both capital and labor freely.

- The firm can build new factories, buy new machines, or shut down facilities
- There are no fixed inputs — every cost is variable
- The firm chooses the optimal combination of $K$ and $L$

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Short-Run Production: One Variable Input

When capital is fixed, the firm's output depends solely on how much labor it employs. Three key measures describe this relationship:

- **Total Product (TP)**: total output produced with a given amount of labor
- **Marginal Product (MP)**: additional output from one more unit of labor — $MP = \frac{\partial TP}{\partial L}$
- **Average Product (AP)**: output per unit of labor — $AP = \frac{TP}{L}$

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns

<Callout type="warning">
The **law of diminishing marginal returns** states that as more units of a variable input (labor) are added to a fixed input (capital), the marginal product of that variable input **eventually decreases**. This is one of the most important laws in economics.
</Callout>

Production with one variable input passes through **three stages**:

1. **Stage I — Increasing returns from variable input**: $MP$ is rising. Each additional worker adds more output than the previous one (e.g., benefits of specialization).
2. **Stage II — Decreasing returns**: $MP$ is falling but still positive. Total output continues to grow, but at a decreasing rate.
3. **Stage III — Negative returns**: $MP$ is negative. Adding more workers actually reduces total output (overcrowding, coordination failures).

<Collapse title="Numerical example: TP, MP, AP">

| $L$ (Workers) | $TP$ (Units) | $MP$ ($\Delta TP / \Delta L$) | $AP$ ($TP / L$) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | — | — |
| 1 | 10 | 10 | 10.0 |
| 2 | 25 | 15 | 12.5 |
| 3 | 45 | 20 | 15.0 |
| 4 | 60 | 15 | 15.0 |
| 5 | 70 | 10 | 14.0 |
| 6 | 75 | 5 | 12.5 |
| 7 | 75 | 0 | 10.7 |
| 8 | 70 | −5 | 8.75 |

- **Stage I** (L = 1–3): MP is rising (10 → 15 → 20), increasing returns from specialization
- **Stage II** (L = 4–7): MP is falling but positive (15 → 10 → 5 → 0), diminishing returns set in
- **Stage III** (L = 8+): MP is negative (−5), workers get in each other's way

Note that $MP = AP$ when $AP$ is at its maximum (at $L = 4$, both equal 15).

</Collapse>

## Long-Run Production

In the long run both $K$ and $L$ are variable. The firm must decide on the **optimal combination** of inputs.

### Isoquants

An **isoquant** is a curve showing all combinations of $K$ and $L$ that produce the **same level of output** — analogous to indifference curves in consumer theory.

- Isoquants are downward-sloping and convex to the origin
- Higher isoquants represent higher output levels
- Isoquants never cross

### Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)

The **MRTS** measures the rate at which one input can be substituted for another while keeping output constant:

$$
MRTS = -\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}
$$

The MRTS diminishes along an isoquant — as you use more labor, each additional unit of labor substitutes for less and less capital.

### Isocost Line

The **isocost line** shows all combinations of $K$ and $L$ the firm can purchase for a given total cost:

$$
w \cdot L + r \cdot K = TC
$$

where $w$ is the wage rate and $r$ is the rental rate of capital.

### Optimal Input Combination

The firm minimizes cost (for a given output) at the **tangency** of the isoquant and isocost line:

$$
MRTS = \frac{w}{r} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \frac{w}{r}
$$

<Callout type="info">
This is the producer's equivalent of the consumer's optimum. Just as a consumer equates MRS to the price ratio, a producer equates MRTS to the input price ratio.
</Callout>

## Returns to Scale

Returns to scale describe what happens to output when **all inputs are scaled by the same factor** $t > 1$:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Increasing Returns">

$$
f(tK, tL) > t \cdot Q
$$

Output grows **faster** than the proportional increase in inputs. Doubling all inputs more than doubles output.

**Causes**: specialization, technical efficiencies at larger scale, volume discounts on inputs.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Constant Returns">

$$
f(tK, tL) = t \cdot Q
$$

Output grows at **exactly the same rate** as inputs. Doubling all inputs exactly doubles output.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Decreasing Returns">

$$
f(tK, tL) < t \cdot Q
$$

Output grows **slower** than the proportional increase in inputs. Doubling all inputs less than doubles output.

**Causes**: management complexity, coordination difficulties, bureaucratic overhead at very large scale.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Short-Run Costs

In the short run, costs are divided into **fixed** and **variable** components:

- **Fixed Costs (FC)**: do not change with output — rent, loan payments, insurance, depreciation of capital
- **Variable Costs (VC)**: change with output — labor costs, raw materials, energy
- **Total Cost**: $TC = FC + VC$

Key average and marginal cost measures:

$$
MC = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}
$$

$$
AC = \frac{TC}{Q}, \quad AVC = \frac{VC}{Q}, \quad AFC = \frac{FC}{Q}, \quad AC = AVC + AFC
$$

<Callout type="info">
Since $FC$ is constant, $MC$ depends **only on variable costs**: $MC = \frac{\Delta VC}{\Delta Q}$. Fixed costs have no effect on the marginal cost of producing one more unit.
</Callout>

<Collapse title="Numerical example: Short-run costs">

Assume $FC = 50$.

| $Q$ | $FC$ | $VC$ | $TC$ | $MC$ | $AFC$ | $AVC$ | $AC$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 50 | 0 | 50 | — | — | — | — |
| 1 | 50 | 30 | 80 | 30 | 50.0 | 30.0 | 80.0 |
| 2 | 50 | 50 | 100 | 20 | 25.0 | 25.0 | 50.0 |
| 3 | 50 | 60 | 110 | 10 | 16.7 | 20.0 | 36.7 |
| 4 | 50 | 80 | 130 | 20 | 12.5 | 20.0 | 32.5 |
| 5 | 50 | 110 | 160 | 30 | 10.0 | 22.0 | 32.0 |
| 6 | 50 | 150 | 200 | 40 | 8.3 | 25.0 | 33.3 |
| 7 | 50 | 200 | 250 | 50 | 7.1 | 28.6 | 35.7 |

Notice: $MC$ first falls (from 30 to 10), then rises — the classic U-shape driven by diminishing returns.

### Relationship Between MC and AC

<Callout type="error">
**Critical relationship** — this appears frequently on exams:
- When $MC < AC$ → $AC$ is **falling**
- When $MC > AC$ → $AC$ is **rising**
- $MC$ intersects $AC$ at its **minimum point**
- $MC$ also intersects $AVC$ at $AVC$'s minimum point
- $AFC$ continuously decreases as output rises (fixed cost spread over more units)
</Callout>

Think of it like a batting average: if your latest score (MC) is below your average (AC), your average falls. If your latest score is above your average, your average rises.

## Long-Run Costs

In the long run, **all costs are variable** — there are no fixed costs. The firm can adjust its plant size, capital stock, and all other inputs.

The **Long-Run Average Cost (LAC)** curve is the **envelope** of all short-run AC curves — for each output level, the firm chooses the plant size that minimizes average cost.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Economies of Scale">

$LAC$ is **falling**. Larger output leads to lower average cost.

Sources: specialization, bulk purchasing, spreading R&D costs, technical efficiencies.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Constant Returns">

$LAC$ is **flat**. Average cost does not change with scale.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Diseconomies of Scale">

$LAC$ is **rising**. Larger output leads to higher average cost.

Sources: management complexity, communication breakdowns, bureaucratic costs.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The output level at which $LAC$ reaches its minimum is called the **minimum efficient scale (MES)** — the smallest output at which a firm can produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost.

## Revenue Concepts

Before analyzing profit maximization, we need three revenue measures:

- **Total Revenue**: $TR = P \cdot Q$
- **Marginal Revenue**: $MR = \frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q}$ — additional revenue from selling one more unit
- **Average Revenue**: $AR = \frac{TR}{Q} = P$

<Callout type="info">
In **perfect competition**, the firm is a price taker, so $P$ is constant: $MR = AR = P$. In **imperfect competition** (monopoly, oligopoly), the firm must lower price to sell more, so $MR < P$.
</Callout>

    return `${profit.toFixed(0)} ${profit >= 0 ? '(profit)' : '(loss)'}`;
  }} />

    const mc = 40 - 20 * v.q + 3 * v.q * v.q;
    if (Math.abs(v.p - mc) < 1) return 'P ≈ MC → optimal!';
    return v.p > mc ? 'P > MC → produce more' : 'P < MC → produce less';
  }} />
</Interactive>

## Profit Maximization

A firm's **economic profit** is:

$$
\pi = TR - TC
$$

### The Profit-Maximizing Condition

A firm maximizes profit by producing where:

$$
MR = MC
$$

This is the **golden rule** of profit maximization: the firm expands output as long as the revenue from one more unit ($MR$) exceeds the cost of producing it ($MC$), and stops where they are equal.

### Profit Outcomes

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Positive Profit">

If $P > AC$ at the profit-maximizing output → the firm earns **positive economic profit** (above-normal profit).

$$
\pi = (P - AC) \times Q > 0
$$

</Tab>
<Tab label="Zero Profit">

If $P = AC$ → the firm earns **zero economic profit** (normal profit). The firm covers all costs including the opportunity cost of capital.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Loss — Continue">

If $P < AC$ but $P > AVC$ → the firm makes a **loss** but continues operating in the short run. Revenue covers all variable costs and part of fixed costs. Shutting down would mean losing all FC.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Shutdown">

If $P < AVC$ → the firm **shuts down**. Revenue does not even cover variable costs — the firm loses less by producing nothing and just paying FC.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="error">
**Shutdown condition**: The firm shuts down in the short run when $P < AVC$. The point where $P = AVC_{\min}$ is called the **shutdown point**. Below this price, the firm produces zero output.
</Callout>

<Collapse title="Derivation: Why MR = MC maximizes profit">

Profit is maximized where the difference between $TR$ and $TC$ is greatest. Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

$$
\frac{d\pi}{dQ} = \frac{dTR}{dQ} - \frac{dTC}{dQ} = MR - MC = 0
$$

$$
\Rightarrow MR = MC
$$

Second-order condition: $\frac{d^2\pi}{dQ^2} < 0$, meaning $MC$ must be rising at the intersection (MC cuts MR from below).
