# Consumer Utility Theory

Consumer theory explains **how and why** individuals make purchasing decisions. At its core is the concept of **utility** — the satisfaction or benefit a consumer derives from consuming goods and services. A rational consumer seeks to **maximize utility** subject to their limited income.

<Callout type="info">
This article builds on the demand concepts from the previous chapter. Here we go deeper into *why* the demand curve slopes downward — it's rooted in how consumers derive satisfaction from goods.
</Callout>

## Total and Marginal Utility

**Total utility (TU)** is the overall satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a certain quantity of a good. **Marginal utility (MU)** is the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit.

$$
MU = \frac{\partial TU}{\partial q}
$$

### Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

As consumption of a good increases (other things being equal), the marginal utility of each additional unit **decreases**. The first glass of water on a hot day is extremely satisfying; the fifth one, much less so.

| Quantity ($q$) | Total Utility ($TU$) | Marginal Utility ($MU$) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | — |
| 1 | 10 | 10 |
| 2 | 18 | 8 |
| 3 | 24 | 6 |
| 4 | 28 | 4 |
| 5 | 30 | 2 |
| 6 | 30 | 0 |

<Callout type="warning">
When $MU = 0$, total utility is at its maximum. Beyond this point, consuming more actually *reduces* total utility — the consumer is oversaturated.
</Callout>

### Consumer Equilibrium with One Good

A rational consumer purchases a quantity of a good where the marginal utility equals the price:

$$
MU = P
$$

If $MU > P$, the consumer gains more satisfaction than the cost and should buy more. If $MU < P$, the last unit costs more than the satisfaction it provides.

## Two-Good Model

In reality, consumers choose between multiple goods. Consider a consumer allocating income between good 1 (quantity $q_1$) and good 2 (quantity $q_2$).

The condition for optimal allocation is that the **marginal utility per monetary unit** must be equal across all goods:

$$
\frac{MU_1}{P_1} = \frac{MU_2}{P_2}
$$

If this condition is violated — say $\frac{MU_1}{P_1} > \frac{MU_2}{P_2}$ — the consumer should shift spending from good 2 to good 1, since each crown spent on good 1 yields more satisfaction.

## Indifference Curves

An **indifference curve** represents all combinations of two goods that yield the **same level of utility** to the consumer. The consumer is indifferent between any two points on the same curve.

### Properties of Indifference Curves

1. **Downward sloping** — to maintain the same utility, consuming more of one good requires consuming less of the other
2. **Do not intersect** — if they did, the same bundle would yield two different utility levels (contradiction)
3. **Convex to the origin** — reflects diminishing marginal rate of substitution
4. **Higher curves = higher utility** — curves farther from the origin represent greater satisfaction

### Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)

The **MRS** measures how much of good 2 the consumer is willing to give up to get one more unit of good 1, while maintaining the same utility level:

$$
MRS = -\frac{\Delta q_2}{\Delta q_1} = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2}
$$

The MRS **decreases** along the indifference curve (from left to right) — reflecting the convex shape and diminishing marginal utility.

### Special Cases of Indifference Curves

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Perfect Substitutes">
When goods are perfectly interchangeable (e.g., red pens vs. blue pens for someone who doesn't care about color), indifference curves are **straight lines** with a constant slope.

The MRS is constant — the consumer is always willing to trade the same amount of one good for the other.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Perfect Complements">
When goods must be consumed in fixed proportions (e.g., left and right shoes), indifference curves are **L-shaped**.

Having extra units of only one good provides no additional utility. The consumer always wants them in a fixed ratio.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Standard Goods">
Most goods produce the typical **convex indifference curves**. The consumer is willing to substitute between goods, but at a diminishing rate.

This is the standard case used in most economic analysis.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Desirable + Undesirable">
If good 2 is undesirable (e.g., pollution), the consumer needs more of the desirable good 1 to compensate for additional units of the bad. Indifference curves **slope upward**.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Budget Constraint

The consumer's choices are limited by their **income (Y)** and the **prices** of goods. The budget constraint is:

$$
P_1 \cdot q_1 + P_2 \cdot q_2 = Y
$$

This defines the **budget line (BL)** — all combinations of $q_1$ and $q_2$ that exactly exhaust the consumer's income.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Maximum $q_1$ (all income on good 1) | $Y / P_1$ |
| Maximum $q_2$ (all income on good 2) | $Y / P_2$ |
| Slope of the budget line | $-P_1 / P_2$ |

### Effect of Price Changes

When the price of good 1 changes:
- **Price increase** → maximum $q_1$ decreases → budget line becomes steeper (rotates around the $q_2$ intercept)
- **Price decrease** → maximum $q_1$ increases → budget line becomes flatter

### Effect of Income Changes

When income changes:
- **Income increase** → budget line shifts **parallel to the right** (both intercepts increase proportionally)
- **Income decrease** → budget line shifts **parallel to the left**

<Callout type="info">
The slope of the budget line depends only on the **ratio of prices** $P_1/P_2$, not on income. A change in income shifts the line but doesn't change its slope.
</Callout>

## Consumer Optimum

The consumer maximizes utility by choosing the combination of goods where the **indifference curve is tangent to the budget line**. At this point:

$$
MRS = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
$$

This means the marginal rate of substitution in consumption equals the **marginal rate of substitution in exchange** (the price ratio). Simultaneously, the consumer spends all their income:

$$
P_1 \cdot q_1 + P_2 \cdot q_2 = Y
$$

<Collapse title="Why tangency is optimal">

At the tangency point E:
- Any other affordable combination (on the budget line) lies on a **lower** indifference curve → less utility
- Any combination on a higher indifference curve is **unaffordable** → lies beyond the budget line
- The slopes are equal: the rate at which the consumer is *willing* to trade goods equals the rate at which the market *allows* them to trade

Therefore, point E gives the **maximum achievable utility** given the budget constraint.
</Collapse>

## Income and Substitution Effects

When the price of a good changes, the consumer adjusts their behavior through two channels:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Substitution Effect">
When good 1 becomes more expensive, it becomes **relatively more costly** compared to good 2. The consumer substitutes away from the now-expensive good toward the relatively cheaper one.

The substitution effect **always** works in the opposite direction to the price change — higher price → less consumption.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Income Effect">
When good 1 becomes more expensive, the consumer's **real purchasing power decreases** (even though nominal income hasn't changed). They can afford less of everything.

For **normal goods**, the income effect reinforces the substitution effect (less real income → less consumption). For **inferior goods**, the income effect works in the opposite direction.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

These two effects together explain why the **demand curve slopes downward**:
- The substitution effect always pushes quantity demanded in the opposite direction of the price change
- For normal goods, the income effect reinforces this
- Only for very unusual inferior goods (Giffen goods) could the income effect be strong enough to override the substitution effect

<Callout type="warning">
**Giffen goods** are a theoretical curiosity where the demand curve slopes *upward*. The income effect is so strong that a price increase actually leads to higher consumption (e.g., staple foods for very poor households where a price increase forces them to consume *more* of the cheap staple and less of expensive alternatives).

## Summary

|---|---|
| Marginal utility | $MU = \frac{\partial TU}{\partial q}$ |
| Optimal allocation (two goods) | $\frac{MU_1}{P_1} = \frac{MU_2}{P_2}$ |
| Budget constraint | $P_1 q_1 + P_2 q_2 = Y$ |
| Consumer optimum | $MRS = \frac{P_1}{P_2}$ and full income spent |
| MRS definition | $MRS = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2}$ |

Consumer theory provides the microeconomic foundation for understanding demand. The next step is to examine the **supply side** — how firms make production decisions and manage costs.
